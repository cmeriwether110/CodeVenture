# CodeVenture
A simple, fun code adventure that takes you on a wild journey (terminal-based/no graphics).

THINGS TO NOTE BEFORE STARTING: 
  -NO re-distribtion/calling it your own for this file
  
  -There (should) be a liscence attached to this repository which further implies the rule above
  
-The main file (game) is coded in c++

-The game is made terminal-based which means that if you came here for the second coming of CSGO, you're out of luck 

-And lastly, have fun and enjoy ;)
